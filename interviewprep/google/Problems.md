In cpp, we can use multiset. But in Java, we need to use TreeMap with counts to account for duplicates.
5% Max TreeMap  |    90% Max TreeMap and Min TreeMap  |   5 % Min TreeMap
Remove nums[i-N] and then insert nums[i]
Order of check is 5 % Min Heap -> 5 % Max TreeMap ->  90% Min-Max TreeMap
Or we can use TreeSet with indexes as key. 
Comparator<Integer> comparator = (a, b) -> nums[a] != nums[b] ? Integer.compare(nums[a], nums[b]) : a - b;
TreeSet<Integer> left = new TreeSet<>(comparator.reversed());
